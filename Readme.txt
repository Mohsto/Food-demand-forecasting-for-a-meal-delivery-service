# Food Demand Forecasting for a Meal Delivery Service

This project tackles the challenge of forecasting meal demand for a delivery 
service operating in multiple cities. Using historical order data, pricing, 
and promotional strategies, the goal is to predict demand for the next 10 weeks 
to assist in inventory and staff planning.

## Data Source
- Dataset from Kaggle: [Meal Delivery Demand Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kannanaikkal/food-demand-forecasting/data)

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights
- **Demand Patterns**: Visualized demand fluctuations and identified key trends 
across centers and meals.
- **Promotional Impact**: Email and homepage promotions significantly boost order volumes.
- **Model Performance**: Random Forest Regression achieved the best RÂ² 
score of 0.809, effectively capturing complex patterns in the data.

## How to Run the Analysis
