# Food-demand-forecasting-for-a-meal-delivery-service
This project focuses on demand forecasting for a meal delivery company operating across multiple cities, which relies on fulfillment centers for dispatching meal orders. The goal is to predict meal demand for the next 10 weeks, helping centers plan their stock of perishable raw materials and staffing needs more efficiently.
